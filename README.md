# Smart-Water-Management-System-arduino
This Arduino-based IoT project uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure tank water levels and a rain sensor to monitor outdoor conditions. The motor pump fills the tank if the water level is low ⚡. Helps conserve water by preventing wastage 🌍. Ideal for home automation &amp; agriculture 🏡🚜.


🌊 Smart Water Management System 💧🚰
This Arduino-based project ensures efficient water usage in homes and farms by using ultrasonic and rain sensors to monitor water levels and determine watering needs. The system automatically controls a motor pump to fill the tank when water levels drop, preventing wastage and promoting conservation 🌍.

🛠️ Components Overview
📡 Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) for Water Level Measurement
- Uses sound waves to determine water tank level 🌊.
- Measures distance to water surface (max: 200 cm) 🏗️.
- Helps in automatic tank filling based on predefined critical value.
🌧️ Rain Sensor for Outdoor Moisture Detection
- Measures rainfall or soil moisture 🏡🌱.
- Analog value determines whether watering is needed 💦.
- Avoids unnecessary water usage if rain is detected.
⚙️ Motor Pump Control
- Automatically turns on/off based on water tank level ⏳.
- If water level falls below 50 cm, pump fills the tank 🚰.
- Uses relay or direct control with Arduino GPIO.
🎛️ Microcontroller: Arduino Uno
- Controls sensor readings, decision logic, and motor pump activation 🧠.
- Interfaces with digital and analog sensors for real-time monitoring 📊.

📌 Pin Configuration Diagram
| Component | Arduino Pin | Type | 
| Ultrasonic Sensor - Trig | 9 | Digital (Output) |
